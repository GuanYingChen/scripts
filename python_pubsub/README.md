Test for the autobahn library where a server publishes two channels ('all', 'diff') with 4 sub channels each ('bi', 'msp', 'cmap', 'tm') using the pub/sub model. This gist simulates scenarios where clients use one channel ('all') to get all the information of the desired object and use the other channel ('diff') to get updates of it.
